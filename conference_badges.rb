#Now you have to tell the printer what to print.
#Create a method called printer that will output first the results of the batch_badge_creator method
#and then of the assign_rooms method to the screen.
#Hint: Remember that methods can call other methods.
#If the return value of assign_rooms is an array of room assignments,
#how can you print out each assignment?
#You'll need to iterate over your array of room assignments in order to puts out each individual assignment.
